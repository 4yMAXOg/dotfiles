My configuration files.

**Warning**: Donâ€™t blindly use my settings unless you know what that
entails. Use at your own risk!

The configuration files are inside `config` folder

## Installation

To install the files use script `create-links.sh`.

If you need to remove previous links run `remove-links.sh`. Use this
script carefully as it can **delete your own files**.
